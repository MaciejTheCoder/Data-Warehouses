# Data-Warehouses
Data Warehouses classes at the University.

The topic of our project was "Tram's course process". Its theoritical goal was to increase number of free seats and reduce the number of courses that have more than 90% of them.

Project has a few parts - the most important one was the ETL process. We had to create Database with source data - in this case data was randomly generated from python script. Then, having ready source databases we created ETL process in SSIS to transfer data to our Datawarehouse.
